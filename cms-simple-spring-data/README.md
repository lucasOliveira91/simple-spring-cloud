# Spring Application - Spring Data JPA

The Spring Data JPA provides an easy way to implement a data access layer using the
JPA specification from Java EE. Usually, these implementations had a lot of
boilerplate and repetitive code and it was hard to maintain the changes in the
database code.

The Spring Data JPA is trying to resolve these issues and provides a
comprehensible way to do that without boilerplate and repetitive code.

The JPA Specification was created by the JCP (Java Community
Process) to help developers to persist, access, and manage data
between Java classes and relational databases. There are some
vendors that implement this specification. The most famous
implementation is Hibernate, and by default, Spring Data JPA uses Hibernate as the JPA implementation.
